There are two sections to running the complete code:
1) Approximate String Matching
2) Evaluation

All the steps are as follows:
1) Ensure all files 'approx_match.c', 'evaluation.py', 'misspell.txt', 'dict.txt', 'correct.txt' are in the same location.
2) Compile the file 'approx_match.c' by typing in "gcc approx_match.c -o approx" in a gcc enabled terminal.
3) Run the object file created by typing in "./approx" on windows.
4) This will produce an output file called 'file.json'.
5) Then finally run 'evaluation.py' in a python enabled terminal as "python evaluation.py" to receive the results of the evaluation. 

**I have included an already processed 'file.json' file in the zip folder.
